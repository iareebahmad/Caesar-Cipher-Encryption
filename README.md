# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption

A simple program that performs **Caesar Cipher** encryption on a given input string.

## 📚 About

Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Caesar Cipher in both **C** and **C++**.

## ✨ Features

- 🔠 Encrypts only alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z)  
- 🅰️ Preserves the case of letters  
- 🔄 Wraps around the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'Z' by 1 becomes 'A')  
- 🖊️ Takes user input for both the string and the shift value  
- 📤 Outputs the encrypted string

## 🛠️ Code Overview

The program:  
1️⃣ Prompts the user to enter a string  
2️⃣ Prompts the user to enter the number of shifts  
3️⃣ Applies the Caesar Cipher shift to each character  
4️⃣ Displays the encrypted string
